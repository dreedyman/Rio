                Rio provides the ability to deploy and provision service
                artifacts and their dependencies. The resolution of artifacts is
                done from configured repositories, and becomes a natural
                extension of the build, test and deploy lifecycle.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Rio deploys services, service artifacts and dependencies are
                automatically provisioned and installed on compute resources
                that meet declared requirements of services being deployed.

                Rio addresses the issue of duplicating dependency management
                configuration between the development and deployment phases by
                ensuring that the versioned components that have been used in
                development, test and qualification are seamlessly carried over.
            </p>
            <div class="section"><h3>Support</h3></div>
            <p>
                The Rio Resolver currently resolves artifacts using configured
                Maven 2 repositories. Using the declaration(s) found in Maven
                POMs and settings. The Rio Resolver is implemented using Aether,
                and the Rio Resolver simply uses Maven repositories to obtain declared
                artifacts and dependencies.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Rio Resolver abstracts the underlying dependency
                resolution implementation in order to give the flexibility to
                potentially support other repository based dependency management
                approaches. <br/><br/>
                In the future we may seek to provide support for
                <a href="http://ant.apache.org/ivy/">Ivy</a> or the
                <a href="http://www.osgi.org/Repository/HomePage">OSGi Bundle Repository</a>.
                Providing an abstraction on top of the concrete dependency management
                solutions gives us flexibility going forward.
            </p>

            <div class="section"><h3>Artifact Declaration</h3></div>
            <p>
                Artifacts are referenced in abstract terms
                (<tt>groupId:artifactId[:type[:classifier]]:version</tt>), rather than a (logical) file
                path. This is the big difference with the use
                of artifacts in opstrings with Rio. Previously, you declared jars as
                resources for both the interface and service implementation classes. With the
                introduction of artifact declaration in opstrings, you now just declare the
                <tt>ggroupId:artifactId[:type[:classifier]]:version</tt> instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                The benefits here are that the declared artifact, it's dependencies
                and any transitive dependencies are resolved. If the machine the Monitor or
                Cybernode is executing on does not have the required jars available, they will be
                provisioned. Its that simple.
            </p>

            <p>
                Declaring artifacts in opstrings follows the same conventions
                that Maven uses. Take a look at the example below:
            </p>

            <img src="images/artifact-declaration.png"/>

            <p>
                The keyword <tt>artifact</tt> in the DSL (or <tt>Artifact</tt> in an XML document)
                triggers artifact resolution. You cannot have both artifact resolution and
                resource declarations in the same opstring.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can also include other opstrings using an artifact. This allows
                external services to be included in the activation of your application.
            </p>

            <img src="images/artifact-oar-include.png"/>

            <p>
                The included artifact is resolved from configured repositories.
                The artifact must have a <tt>.oar</tt> extension. Once located,
                the resolved OAR is included in the deployment and subsequent
                management of the declared service(s).
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div id="infobox">
                <img src="images/information.gif"/>
                OAR artifact inclusion is only supported with Groovy based opstrings.
            </div>
            <br/>
            <div class="section"><h3>Artifact Resolution</h3></div>
            <p>
                Artifacts and dependencies are resolved from repositories. The Rio
                resolver obtains repository configuration from POMs and from
                your <tt>settings.xml</tt>.  When service artifacts are being resolved,
                repository configurations are lazily obtained, appending configured
                repository definitions from POMs (if declared), and filtering them
                against any declared mirror declarations in <tt>settings.xml</tt>.
                Maven central is always included last.
            </p>

            <div id="tipbox">
                <img src="images/check.gif"/>
                It is generally a good idea that the &lt;repositories&gt;
                section be removed from POMs, and repositories be specified only in
                settings.xml. This makes for cleaner and predictable
                deployments.
            </div>

            <p>
                By translating <tt>groupId:artifactId:[classifier:]version</tt> to
                <tt>groupId/artifactId/version</tt> we can derive the location of
                the artifact and download it to the (configured) local repository.
                If there are issues with the message digests not matching, the
                retrieval of the artifact is retried. If there are still issues with
                the message digests not matching, the Rio Resolver will not provision
                the artifact. In Maven terms, this follows a <tt>checksumPolicy</tt>
                set to <tt>fail</tt>.
            </p>
                        
            <div id="tipbox">
                <img src="images/check.gif"/>
                We highly recommend the use of a repository manager.
            </div>

            <div class="section"><h4>Automatic Dependency Exclusions</h4></div>

                Dependency scope is used to limit the transitivity of a dependency, and also
                to affect the resolved classpath for a service. The following scopes are
                automatically excluded:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>test</b><br/>
                        This scope indicates that the dependency is not required
                        for normal use of the application, and is only available
                        for the test compilation and execution phases.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>provided</b><br/>
                        Indicates you expect the dependency to be provided at runtime.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>system</b><br/>
                        Indicates you have to provide the dependency. The artifact is always
                        available and is not looked up in a repository.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>optional</b><br/>
                        Although not a dependency <i>scope</i>, dependencies declared
                        as optional are automatically excluded.
                    </li>
                </ul>
