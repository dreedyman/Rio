            <div class="section"><h3>Release Information</h3></div>
            <p>
                Rio is distributed under the <a href="license.html">Apache License, version 2.0</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rio requires JDK 1.7.x or greater.
            </p>

            <div id="tipbox">
                <img src="images/check.gif"/>
                Although not required, setting the JAVA_HOME environment
                variable to point to the home of a Java 7 (or later) installation
                is always a good idea.
            </div>
            <p>
                Rio is distributed with dependencies. Dependencies are additional
                software required for running Rio. Note that each of these libraries
                is subject to the respective license; check the respective project
                distribution/website before using any of them in your own environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The distribution includes the following third party technology: Apache River 2.2.2 (Jini),
                Hyperic SIGAR, Commons Compress 1.0, Groovy, SLF4J, Logback and the
                Prefuse Visualization Toolkit.
            </p>


            <div class="section"><h3>Installing</h3></div>
            <p>
                To install Rio on Linux or OS/X, unzip the distribution package
                to the desired installation directory. For example, to install into <tt>/opt</tt>:
            </p>
            <p>
                <tt>unzip rio-5.8.0.zip -d /opt</tt>
            </p>
            <p>This creates a directory called <tt>rio-5.8.0</tt> under <tt>/opt</tt></p>

            <p>
                To install Rio on Windows, unzip the distribution package to the
                desired installation directory. You should use a zip application such
                as 7zip, not the built-in folder decompression. Note that both Windows
                and Java 5 have some issues with long file names and file paths, as
                well as with spaces in directory names. We recommend installing into a
                directory of your chosen drive, and ensuring that directory names do not
                have spaces (like C:\Program Files).
            </p>
            <div class="section"><h3>Examining the distribution</h3></div>

            <p>
                Once you have unzipped the distribution, you will have a

                    You will be prompted to enter the artifactId, service to

            <div class="section"><h3>Starting Rio</h3>
                <p>
                    The <tt>RIO_HOME/bin</tt> directory contains starter script
                    (and .cmd) files to start Services and Utilities provided by Rio.
                </p>

                <div id="infobox">
                    <img src="images/information.gif"/>
                    Note, you should make sure that you set the <tt>RIO_HOME</tt>
                    environment variable to point to the directory that you have
                    installed the Rio distribution.
                </div>

                <p>
                    The <tt>rio</tt> script is the the command and control utility
                    for starting Rio services and the Rio command line interface.
                    All of the other scripts are wrappers around the <tt>rio</tt>
                    script. The convention for starting services using the <tt>rio</tt>
                    scripts is as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><tt>rio start</tt> <i>service-starter</i></li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    For example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><tt>rio start cybernode</tt><br/>
                        <p>Will use the <tt>config/start-cybernode.groovy</tt> file</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><tt> rio start all</tt><br/>
                        <p>Will use the <tt>config/start-all.groovy</tt> file</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The following scripts are shortcuts for starting the basic services in Rio:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>cybernode</b> - Starts a Cybernode and a Webster on an anonymous port</li>
                    <li><b>monitor</b> - Starts a Provision Monitor, a transient Jini Lookup service
                        and a Webster on port 9010</li>
                    <li><b>webster</b> - Starts a Webster on port 9010</li>
                    <li><b>startall</b> - Starts a Webster on port 9010, a Cybernode,
                        Provision Monitor and a transient Jini Lookup Service</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    By just running <tt>rio</tt>, you will be put into the interactive command line shell:
                </p>
                <div class="source">
<pre>Welcome to the Rio Interactive Shell Program. You can interact
with the Rio using the following commands :

list     http     deploy   destroy  dir
help     pwd      jconsole redeploy set
undeploy cd       ls       stats

For help on any of these commands type help [command].
