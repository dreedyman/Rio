  <title>Event Framework</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Provides classes and interfaces which enable support for distributed
events. The distributed event model found within Rio extends Jini&trade;
events
providing an easier to use model with increased semantics. The Rio
event model makes it easy to implement Jini events. The Rio event model
provides a straightforward producer-consumer model with built in
leasing.</p>
<p>The Rio Event Model provides the basis to craft a loosely coupled
architecture that allows event producers to advertise event attributes,
and event clients to discover event producers that produce the event(s)
they are interested in.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This capability enables a peer-to-peer semantic allowing the
exchange of event objects that indicate a change in state in the
distributed system. Event consumers construct leased event
registrations and are notified of the change in state by event
producers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>By using a loosely coupled architecture, it becomes easier to adapt
to changes. Interdependencies found in tightly coupled RPC oriented
environments are removed with loosely coupled architectures. We can
replace (or add) implementations at either end (event producer or event
consumer) without altering existing components. By using a loosely
coupled architecture we are able to more easily adapt to an unforeseen
forward fit, replace defective component(s) online and scale a system
dynamically. Overall these capabilities greatly minimize total
development risk and cost. <br>
</p>
<p>The following event mechanisms are discussed below:<br>

</ul>
<br>
<p> </p>
<p><b><font size="+1"><a name="Event_Descriptors"></a>Event Descriptors</font></b>
<br>
A {@link org.rioproject.event.EventDescriptor} provides a simple semantic
for
specifying and
discovering event producers of a specific kind of event. A {@link
org.rioproject.event.EventDescriptor} is an attribute, part of the
description
of an <a href="#Event_Producers_">Event Producer</a> that is producing
an event object described by a {@link
org.rioproject.event.EventDescriptor}.&nbsp; </p>
Event objects may be simple to just indicate that an event has
occurred or be rich containing other information about the event. For
example, a snapshot of an object's state may be included with the event
as it is delivered.<br>
<p>EventDescriptor&#8217;s may also be used for matching events for
consumption. This will be explained in the <a href="#Event_Consumer_">Event
Consumer</a> section
below.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b><font size="+1"><a name="Event_Producers_"></a>Event Producers</font></b>
<br>
Any service can be an Event Producer, that is. a service that has a
zero-to-many dependency between objects so that when its state changes
all its dependents are notified. This semantic is also known as the
observer-observable and/or publish-subscribe pattern.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Rio adds to this capability by providing the notion that event
producers have the flexibility to choose a notification policy, that is
to say. event producers dictate event distribution mechanisms.&nbsp; </p>
Event distribution mechanisms are based on an abstract EventHandler
framework allowing the creation of multiple event dispatch mechanisms.<br>
<ul>
  <li> <b>DispatchEventHandler</b></li>
A change of state in a DispatchEventHandler causes all of its valid
event registrants&nbsp;(remote event listeners) to be notified.
The EventProducer invokes the DispatchEventHandler&#8217;s fire() method to
fire the event object reflecting the change in state of the
EventProducer. The order in which notifications will be delivered is
the order in which they registered interest&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <li> <b>RoundRobinEventHandler</b></li>
A change of state in a RoundRobinEventHandler causes a single valid
event registrant to be notified of the change in a round-robin fashion.
The EventProducer invokes the RoundRobinEventHandler&#8217;s fire() method to
fire the event object reflecting the change in state of the
EventProducer. The order in which notifications will be delivered is
the order in which they registered interest&nbsp;
  <p>For each subsequent notification the next event registrant
in the list will be notified. If event registrants are removed from the
collection of event registrants and the notification ordinal references
the removed event registrant, then the notification ordinal will
reference the next event registrant in the collection</p>
</ul>
<br>
<font size="+1"><a name="Event_Consumer_"></a>Event Consumer</font> <br>
The recipients of an EventProducer&#8217;s event object are {@link
org.rioproject.event.EventConsumer} instances.
The EventConsumer framework provides helper classes that manage the
discovery of EventProducer instances that provide support for user
defined events. <a href="#Configuring_the_Event_Consumer"><br>
</a>
<ul>
  <li> <b>BasicEventConsumer</b></li>
The {@link org.rioproject.event.BasicEventConsumer} implements the{@link
org.rioproject.event.EventConsumer}&nbsp; interface, which
extends the Jini {@link net.jini.core.event.RemoteEventListener}. The
{@link org.rioproject.event.BasicEventConsumer}, used as a
local utility, manages the event registration and leasing of event
registrations on behalf of a client. In this manner, clients wishing to
easily register (subscribe) for the notification of an event in the
distributed system need not be overly concerned with the underlying
semantics and management of event registrations, leases and
events&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
  </span>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> <b>DynamicEventConsumer</b></li>
The DynamicEventConsumer extends the BasicEventConsumer and provides
the capability to discover when new EventProducer instances that
produce interested events appear on the network and to recognize when
EventProducer instances that produce interested events leave the
network&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <li> <b>PooledEventConsumer</b></li>
The PooledEventConsumer extends DynamicEventConsumer and provides the
capability to use a Thread Pool to simultaneously handle multiple
events.
