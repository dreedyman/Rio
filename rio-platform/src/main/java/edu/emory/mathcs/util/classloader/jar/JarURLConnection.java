/**
 * Alternative implementation of {@link java.net.JarURLConnection} which
 * supports customizable JAR caching policies. It addresses bugs
 * 4405789, 4388666, 4639900 in Java Bug Parade. SUN recommends to disable
 * caches completely as a workaround for those bugs; however, this may
 * significantly affect performance in case of resources downloaded from the
 * network. This class is a part of the solution that allows to tailor the
 * caching policy according to the program needs, with cache-per-classloader
 * default policy.
