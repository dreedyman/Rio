Rio
===

Rio is an open source technology that provides a dynamic architecture for developing, deploying and
managing distributed systems composed of services.

Rio turns a network of compute resources into a dynamic service, providing a policy based approach for fault
detection and recovery, scalability and dynamic deployment. Key to the architecture are a set of dynamic
capabilities and reliance on policy-based and SLA mechanisms.

Developing services for use with Rio is simple. Rio provides a non-intrusive model that removes the complexity
surrounding service development and deployment.
