  <title>Event Framework</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Provides classes and interfaces which enable support for distributed
events. The distributed event model found within Rio extends River events
providing an easier to use model with increased semantics. The Rio
event model makes it easy to implement  events. The Rio event model
provides a straightforward producer-consumer model with built in
leasing.</p>
<p>The Rio Event Model provides the basis to craft a loosely coupled
architecture that allows event producers to advertise event attributes,
and event clients to discover event producers that produce the event(s)
they are interested in.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This capability enables a peer-to-peer semantic allowing the
exchange of event objects that indicate a change in state in the
distributed system. Event consumers construct leased event
registrations and are notified of the change in state by event
producers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>By using a loosely coupled architecture, it becomes easier to adapt
to changes. Interdependencies found in tightly coupled RPC oriented
environments are removed with loosely coupled architectures. We can
replace (or add) implementations at either end (event producer or event
consumer) without altering existing components. By using a loosely
coupled architecture we are able to more easily adapt to an unforeseen
forward fit, replace defective component(s) online and scale a system
dynamically. Overall these capabilities greatly minimize total
development risk and cost. <br>
