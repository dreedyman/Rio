/**
 * AssociationManagement provides the necessary support to manage Associations a
 * ServiceBean has to other services. Associations provide a mechanism to model
 * and enforce uses and requires associations between services in an
 * OperationalString. Associations are optional and may be declared as part of a
 * ServiceBean element's specification. Associations take 2 forms:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b><u>Uses </u> </b> <br>
 * A weak association relationship where if A uses B exists then, then B may be
 * present for A
 * <li><b><u>Requires </u> </b> <br>
 * A stronger association relationship where if A requires B exists then B must
 * be present for A
 * <li><b><u>Colocated</u> </b> <br>
 * An association which requires that A be colocated with B in the same
 * JVM. If B does not exist, or cannot be located, A shall not be created
 * without B
 * <li><b><u>Opposed</u> </b> <br>
 * An association which requires that A exist in a different JVM then B.
 * <li><b><u>Isolated</u> </b> <br>
 * An association which requires that A exist in a different machine then B.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Associations are created during the design/modelling phase and enforced
 * during runtime The AssociationManager will discover and monitor services
 * described in each Association. An Association will either be discovered,
 * changed or broken. Each state transition an Association goes through will
 * result in the notification of any AssociationListener objects which have
 * registered to this AssociationManagement instance. If the Association is of
 * type <code>AssociationType.REQUIRES</code> and the Association state
 * becomes <code>Association.BROKEN</code> <b>and there are no services </b>
 * that match the Association type that have a state of
 * <code>Association.DISCOVERED</code>, then the AssociationManagement object
 * will unadvertise the ServiceBean using the provided ServiceBeanControl
 * interface. Conversely, if the Association is of type
 * <code>AssociationType.REQUIRES</code> and a service is discovered which
 * matches the service type(s), then the Association state becomes
 * <code>Association.DISCOVERED</code>. If the ServiceBean is not advertised,
 * the AssociationManager will advertise the ServiceBean
