     * for each method invocation until that service is no longer reachable.
     * If the associated service is unavailable, the fail-over strategy invokes
     * the next service in it's list.

     * association, alternating the selection of associated services using a
     * round-robin approach.

     * services running on compute resources whose system resources are not

     * resources are depleted, the service hosted in that Cybernode will not
     * be invoked. This is of particular use in cases where out of memory
     * conditions may occur. Using the utilization strategy a service running
     * in a memory constrained Cybernode will not be invoked until the JVM
     * performs garbage collection and memory is reclaimed.
