Provides mechanisms to collect and analyze programmer defined metrics
defined in a distributed application. This framework may be used to
instrument services developed under the Rio Architecture and to monitor
performance and other measurable aspects of distributed operational
strings of execution using this architecture.<br>
<br>
The approach outlined in this document provides the basis for recording
a measurement of a metric. Recording can be done either locally within
a JVM or remotely across different JVM&#8217;s. Depending on the type
of metric being observed (watched), the type of watch differs:<br>
<ul>
  <li>A {@link org.rioproject.impl.watch.CounterWatch} provides a mechanism to
count a monotonically increasing non-negative value of an arbitrary
occurance of something over time</li>
  <li>A {@link org.rioproject.impl.watch.GaugeWatch} provides a mechanism to
record values that can go up and down, and can be positive or negative.</li>
  <li>A {@link org.rioproject.impl.watch.StopWatch} is a Watch for capturing
elapsed time</li>
</ul>
Each of these watches extend from {@link
org.rioproject.impl.watch.ThresholdWatch}, which contains {@link
org.rioproject.watch.ThresholdValues}, which in turn can have {@link
org.rioproject.sla.SLA}s attached to them providing specific {@link
org.rioproject.impl.sla.SLAPolicyHandler}s approaches.<br>
<br>
Watches record {@link org.rioproject.watch.Calculable} objects which
contain the value of the metric being observed and the time when the
metric was captured. These object sre stored in a {@link
org.rioproject.watch.WatchDataSource}. The WatchDataSource can be
transient or persistent, and provides a repository for given watch
instance Calculables.<br>
<br>
While the Watch framework is generic in that it can collect any kind of
metric, a common use will be to measure application response times. It
is useful to analyze this type of measurement to understand the
Watchable Framework.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Within an application, a bounded unit of work can be measured for
execution time. Because, the Service Bean and Service Container model
is inherently distributed, this bounded unit of work may be local to
one Java Virtual Machine or span multiple Java Virtual Machines. (If
end points are distributed some mechanism for clock synchronization is
required. Clock synchronization is beyond the scope of this document.) <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Local Watches</span><br>
<br>
The simplest case is to measure response time within a local Java
Virtual Machine. The main steps in measuring these response time
metrics are:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<ol>
  <li>Create the StopWatch which:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Creates a local instance of a WatchDataSource</li>
    <li>Associates the WatchDataSource to the StopWatch</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Register the WatchDataSource with the WatchDataSourceRegistry.
This allows the WatchDataSource to be discovered by remote clients</li>
  <li>Start the timing</li>
  <li>Stop the timing which:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Calculates the elapsed time</li>
    <li>Creates a Calculable object</li>
    <li>Adds the Calculable object to the WatchDataSource</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Repeat Steps #3 and #4 as necessary</li>
  <li>Examine the results</li>
</ol>
The &#8220;StopWatch&#8221; class is essentially a utility class used for capturing
this elapsed execution time. A Calculable record is created and then
stored in the WatchDataSource. The getValue method of the Calculable
interface returns a double value which represents the milliseconds of
elapsed time for this measurement. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Remote Watches </span><br>
The next case is to measure response time within a local Java Virtual
Machine, but post the results to a remote WatchDataSource. This kind of
pattern is useful when the desired outcome is a common collection of
metrics from various services or from numerous instances of the same
service. The main steps in measuring these response time metrics
are:&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<ol>
  <li>Find the remote WatchDataSource</li>
  <li>Associate the WatchDataSource with the StopWatch</li>
  <li>Start the timing</li>
  <li>Stop the timing which:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Calculates the elapsed time</li>
    <li>Creates a Calculable object</li>
    <li>Adds the Calculable object to the WatchDataSource</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Repeat Steps #3 and #4 as necessary</li>
  <li>Examine the results</li>
</ol>
The primary difference here is that the WatchDataSource is first
located using the Jini Lookup Service. Once located, the constructor
for the StopWatch is invoked passing the reference to the remote
WatchDataSource. Once the StopWatch has been created in this way, the
rest of the processing steps are the same as the local case. <br>
